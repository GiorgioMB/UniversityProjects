# University Projects

Welcome to my University Projects repository. Here, I showcase the diverse projects undertaken during my time at Bocconi University, developed individually, through coursework, and via my active participation in student associations such as BAINSA (Bocconi Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience Association), BSDSA (Bocconi Students Data Science Association), and BSML (Bocconi Students for Machine Learning).

## About Me
I'm Giorgio Micaletto, a second-year student at Bocconi University, where I am pursuing a degree in Economics, Management, and Computer Science. My academic journey has been enriched through my engagement in various student associations and a role as a research intern in the finance department at my university. I am currently a research assistant at Aalto University, working on approximating Cross-Validation Leave One Group Out error in bayesian models.
