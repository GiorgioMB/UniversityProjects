# University Projects

Welcome to my University Projects repository. Here, I showcase the diverse projects undertaken during my time at Bocconi University, developed individually, through coursework, and via my active participation in student associations such as BAINSA (Bocconi Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience Association), BSDSA (Bocconi Students Data Science Association), and BSML (Bocconi Students for Machine Learning).

## Projects Overview

### BAINSA, BSDSA, BSML Projects
- **Description**: A collection of projects done in collaboration with BAINSA, BSDSA and BSML, reflecting my engagement with data science and machine learning.
- **Key Learnings**: Hyperparameters optimization, Feature Map explanation, Dimensionality Reduction, Sequential Model architecture, External API usage, Image processing, Object Detection, Adaptive Data Loading.

### Sentiment Analysis of Financial Headlines using BERT
- **Description**: This project involves using the BERT model for sentiment analysis of financial headlines, offering insights into market trends and investor sentiment.
-  **Key Learnings**: Introduction to NLP Models.

### BELKA Competition
- **Description**: This project was a submission for the BELKA competition hosted on Kaggle, where the objective was to predict the binding affinity of a given molecule and protein
- **Key Learnings**: Parallel Processing, Graph Transformer Convolutional Network, Implementation of Experimental Layer proposed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04325).

### Quantum Machine Learning
- **Description**: This project explores the use of PQCs (Parameterized Quantum Circuits) and PQC-MLP (PQC-Multi-Layer Perceptron) hybrids to evaluate their performance in various classification and regression tasks. It involves testing a novel fitting method and comparing the capabilities of these quantum-based models against current state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures.
- **Key Learnings**: Parametrized Quantum Circuits, Vision Transformer, Convolutional Transformers, Adversarial Attacks.

### Course-Related Projects
- **Description**: This folder contains all the required and elective projects I completed during my studies.
- **Key Learnings**: R, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Evaluation and Interpretation, Feature Engineering, Genetic Algorithms, Randomer Forest, Deprecated Library Restoration, Data Imputation, Stochastic Optimization.

## About Me
My name is Giorgio Micaletto, and I am currently a third-year student at Bocconi University, pursuing a BSc in Economics, Management, and Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively contributed to several student associations and gained valuable research experience. 

As a research intern at both the Department of Finance at Bocconi and the Aalto University School of Science, I have focused on advancing statistical methodologies, including the development of diagnostic tools for the bridgesampling method, enhancing model validation processes.
