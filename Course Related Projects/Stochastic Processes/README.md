# Existence of the Martingale Problem on Random Manifolds

## Overview

This repository hosts the slide deck for an *upper-level undergraduate lecture* on the **Existence of the Martingale Problem on Random Manifolds**. 
The talk surveys geometric and analytic techniques that guarantee weak existence (and outlines open problems for strong existence) of diffusion processes whose state space is itself random.

## Context & Purpose

* **Audience:** Undergraduate students enrolled in *Applied Stochastic Processes* (Spring 2025, Università Bocconi)
* **Date:** 25 May 2025
* **Motivation:** The lecture was delivered as an elective assignment that earned **one additional credit** for the course.
