# Project Overview
This project was undertaken as an introduction to Optimization during the second year of studies. The primary objective was to develop an algorithm capable of efficiently finding the global optimum in a challenging landscape generated by a custom data function. As the sole developer, I implemented and refined a Simulated Annealing (SimAnn) algorithm, enhancing its functionality and integrating it with a dynamic grid class to solve the optimization problem effectively.

While the scope of the project is intentionally limited, it served as a foundational exercise in optimization techniques, with a focus on practical implementation and exploration of key concepts.

# Key Contributions and Improvements

## 1. Enhancements to the SimAnn Algorithm

- **Dynamic Temperature Scheduling:**
  - Created a hybrid temperature schedule combining linear and logarithmic beta progressions for better exploration and exploitation balance.
  - Allocated a third of the annealing steps to a logarithmic schedule and two-thirds to a linear one, ensuring efficient convergence.

- **Early Stopping Criteria:**
  - Introduced two stopping criteria to reduce unnecessary computations:
    - **Patience-Based Termination:** The algorithm halts after a defined number of iterations (`wait`) without move acceptance.
    - **Cost-Based Termination:** The algorithm terminates if no cost improvement is observed for a specified number of iterations (`wait_2`).

- **Move Scaling:**
  - Implemented a move scaling mechanism using a random multiplier to allow larger exploration steps dynamically, reducing the likelihood of getting trapped in local optima.

- **Frequency Analysis:**
  - Added functionality to plot the frequency of accepted moves against the beta values, providing insights into the algorithm's behavior across iterations.

## 2. Characteristics of the Grid Class

- **Dynamic Cost Precomputation:**
  - Optimized the calculation of neighborhood costs using efficient matrix operations, enabling faster evaluation of move proposals.

- **Enhanced Visualization:**
  - Developed plotting functions to visually track the algorithm's progress:
    - Displaying the current position, visited cells, and the final path of exploration.
    - Highlighting the landscape's beta values and the grid's structure.

- **State Management:**
  - Added tracking for visited cells and a history of positions, aiding both visualization and debugging.

# Project Structure

- **Grid Class:** Handles the problem's landscape representation, cost computation, and move proposals.

# Workflow
1. **Data Generation:** The landscape is generated based on parameters like grid size and an individual ID.
2. **Grid Initialization:** The Grid class initializes the problem space and computes initial costs.
3. **Algorithm Execution:** The SimAnn algorithm iteratively explores the grid, minimizing the cost function until termination criteria are met.
4. **Visualization:** Results are visualized to evaluate the algorithm's performance and convergence.

# Libraries Used
